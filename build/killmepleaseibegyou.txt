I've tried putting a weapon(skeletal mesh) onto a socket I have in the hand of the skeleton, but it doesn't work on the first person controller. I've followed some tutorials and they all work great for third person controllers, but they all break when it goes to first person. [It has been asked before here but I don't understand the question at all.][1]


I attach a socket to a finger bone like normal, and attach a statue to it. It looks fine in the preview.

It gets attached at the feet of the character.

Here's my level blueprint, I've seen this exact script in many different tutorials.

I am completely stuck
